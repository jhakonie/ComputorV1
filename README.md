## ComputorV1

A HIVE project where you create a second degree equatin solver using any language you prefer. I decided to try out python for the first time.
An equation is given as argument and the program must produce real and complex answers and recognize the degree of the equation.
This project was mainly an excercise in lexical analysis and parsing.
